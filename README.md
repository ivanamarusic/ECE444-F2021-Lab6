Ivana Marusic - code ref: https://github.com/mjhea0/flaskr-tdd

pros:

- It is good practice to write tests for every part of code
- There will be less errors in the code
- The code will be better documented and divided nicely into modules
- There will be less deviations from the original plan when using TDD
- It is easy to plan a project with TDD, the programmer must fully understand what they will be implementing if they start by making a test

cons:

- It is more time consuming to do TDD, spending time writing tests for every aspect of the project may take too long for projects that need to be completed quickly
- The TDD approach is more difficult to do and plan for
- It is more difficult to change the plan of a project if TDD is used
- To be effective all members of the team must implement TDD
